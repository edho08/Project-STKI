CHAPTER 20. DEEP GENERATIVE MODELS

We begin with the binary version of the restricted Boltzmann machine, but as we see later there are extensions to other types of visible and hidden units.

More formally, let the observed layer consist of a set of n v binary random variables which we refer to collectively with the vector v. We refer to the latent or

hidden layer of nh binary random variables as h.

Like the general Boltzmann machine, the restricted Boltzmann machine is an

energy-based model with the joint probability distribution specified by its energy

function:

P (v

=

v, h = h)

=

1 Z

exp (-E(v, h)) .

(20.4)

The energy function for an RBM is given by

E(v, h) = -bv - ch - vW h,

(20.5)

and Z is the normalizing constant known as the partition function:



Z=

exp {-E(v, h)} .

(20.6)

vh

It is apparent from the definition of the partition function Z that the naive method of computing Z (exhaustively summing over all states) could be computationally intractable, unless a cleverly designed algorithm could exploit regularities in the probability distribution to compute Z faster. In the case of restricted Boltzmann machines, Long and Servedio (2010) formally proved that the partition function Z is intractable. The intractable partition function Z implies that the normalized joint probability distribution P (v) is also intractable to evaluate.

20.2.1 Conditional Distributions

Though P (v) is intractable, the bipartite graph structure of the RBM has the very special property that its conditional distributions P(h | v) and P (v | h) are factorial and relatively simple to compute and to sample from.

Deriving the conditional distributions from the joint distribution is straightforward:

P (h, v)

P (h | v) =

P (v)
