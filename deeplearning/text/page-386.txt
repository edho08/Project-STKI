CHAPTER 9. CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS
Figure 9.19: Many machine learning algorithms learn features that detect edges or specific colors of edges when applied to natural images. These feature detectors are reminiscent of the Gabor functions known to be present in primary visual cortex. (Left)Weights learned by an unsupervised learning algorithm (spike and slab sparse coding) applied to small image patches. (Right)Convolution kernels learned by the first layer of a fully supervised convolutional maxout network. Neighboring pairs of filters drive the same maxout unit.
9.11 Convolutional Networks and the History of Deep Learning
Convolutional networks have played an important role in the history of deep learning. They are a key example of a successful application of insights obtained by studying the brain to machine learning applications. They were also some of the first deep models to perform well, long before arbitrary deep models were considered viable. Convolutional networks were also some of the first neural networks to solve important commercial applications and remain at the forefront of commercial applications of deep learning today. For example, in the 1990s, the neural network research group at AT&T developed a convolutional network for reading checks (LeCun et al., 1998b). By the end of the 1990s, this system deployed by NEC was reading over 10% of all the checks in the US. Later, several OCR and handwriting recognition systems based on convolutional nets were deployed by Microsoft (Simard et al., 2003). See chapter 12 for more details on such applications and more modern applications of convolutional networks. See LeCun et al. (2010) for a more in-depth history of convolutional networks up to 2010.
Convolutional networks were also used to win many contests. The current intensity of commercial interest in deep learning began when Krizhevsky et al. (2012) won the ImageNet object recognition challenge, but convolutional networks
