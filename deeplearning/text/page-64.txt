CHAPTER 2. LINEAR ALGEBRA

monotonically increasing for non-negative arguments.
c  = arg min ||x - g(c)||22.
c
The function being minimized simplifies to

(2.55)

(x - g(c))(x - g(c))

(2.56)

(by the definition of the L2 norm, equation 2.30)

= xx - xg(c) - g(c)x + g(c)g(c)

(2.57)

(by the distributive property) = xx - 2xg(c) + g(c)g(c)

(2.58)

(because the scalar g(c) x is equal to the transpose of itself).
We can now change the function being minimized again, to omit the first term, since this term does not depend on c:

c = arg min-2xg(c) + g(c)g(c).
c

(2.59)

To make further progress, we must substitute in the definition of g(c):

c = arg min -2xDc + cD Dc
c
= arg min -2x Dc + cIl c
c
(by the orthogonality and unit norm constraints on D)

(2.60) (2.61)

= arg min -2xDc + cc
c

(2.62)

We can solve this optimization problem using vector calculus (see section 4.3 if you do not know how to do this):

c(-2xDc + cc) = 0 - 2Dx + 2c = 0 c = D x.
