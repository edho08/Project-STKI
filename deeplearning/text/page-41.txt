CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
that neuroscientists can study (DiCarlo, 2013). Deep learning also provides useful tools for processing massive amounts of data and making useful predictions in scientific fields. It has been successfully used to predict how molecules will interact in order to help pharmaceutical companies design new drugs (Dahl et al., 2014), to search for subatomic particles (Baldi et al., 2014), and to automatically parse microscope images used to construct a 3-D map of the human brain (KnowlesBarley et al., 2014). We expect deep learning to appear in more and more scientific fields in the future.
In summary, deep learning is an approach to machine learning that has drawn heavily on our knowledge of the human brain, statistics and applied math as it developed over the past several decades. In recent years, it has seen tremendous growth in its popularity and usefulness, due in large part to more powerful computers, larger datasets and techniques to train deeper networks. The years ahead are full of challenges and opportunities to improve deep learning even further and bring it to new frontiers.
