CHAPTER 10. SEQUENCE MODELING: RECURRENT AND RECURSIVE NETS
because it lacks hidden-to-hidden recurrent connections. For example, it cannot simulate a universal Turing machine. Because this network lacks hidden-to-hidden recurrence, it requires that the output units capture all of the information about the past that the network will use to predict the future. Because the output units are explicitly trained to match the training set targets, they are unlikely to capture the necessary information about the past history of the input, unless the user knows how to describe the full state of the system and provides it as part of the training set targets. The advantage of eliminating hidden-to-hidden recurrence is that, for any loss function based on comparing the prediction at time t to the training target at time t, all the time steps are decoupled. Training can thus be parallelized, with the gradient for each step t computed in isolation. There is no need to compute the output for the previous time step first, because the training set provides the ideal value of that output.

Figure 10.5: Time-unfolded recurrent neural network with a single output at the end of the sequence. Such a network can be used to summarize a sequence and produce a fixed-size representation used as input for further processing. There might be a target right at the end (as depicted here) or the gradient on the output o(t) can be obtained by back-propagating from further downstream modules.
Models that have recurrent connections from their outputs leading back into the model may be trained with teacher forcing. Teacher forcing is a procedure that emerges from the maximum likelihood criterion, in which during training the model receives the ground truth output y(t) as input at time t + 1. We can see this by examining a sequence with two time steps. The conditional maximum
