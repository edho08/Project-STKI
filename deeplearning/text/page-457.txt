CHAPTER 11. PRACTICAL METHODOLOGY
to underfitting or due to a problem with the training data. One of the debugging strategies we recommend is to visualize the model's worst errors. In this case, that meant visualizing the incorrect training set transcriptions that the model gave the highest confidence. These proved to mostly consist of examples where the input image had been cropped too tightly, with some of the digits of the address being removed by the cropping operation. For example, a photo of an address "1849" might be cropped too tightly, with only the "849" remaining visible. This problem could have been resolved by spending weeks improving the accuracy of the address number detection system responsible for determining the cropping regions. Instead, the team took a much more practical decision, to simply expand the width of the crop region to be systematically wider than the address number detection system predicted. This single change added ten percentage points to the transcription system's coverage.
Finally, the last few percentage points of performance came from adjusting hyperparameters. This mostly consisted of making the model larger while maintaining some restrictions on its computational cost. Because train and test error remained roughly equal, it was always clear that any performance deficits were due to underfitting, as well as due to a few remaining problems with the dataset itself.
Overall, the transcription project was a great success, and allowed hundreds of millions of addresses to be transcribed both faster and at lower cost than would have been possible via human effort.
We hope that the design principles described in this chapter will lead to many other similar successes.
