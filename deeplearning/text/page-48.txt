the i-th column of A. When we need to explicitly identify the elements of

a matrix, we write them as an array enclosed in square brackets:

 A1,1

Sometimes we may need to index matrix-valued expressions that are not just a single letter. In this case, we use subscripts after the expression, but do not convert anything to lower case. For example, f (A)i,j gives element (i, j) of the matrix computed by applying the function f to A.
· Tensors: In some cases we will need an array with more than two axes. In the general case, an array of numbers arranged on a regular grid with a variable number of axes is known as a tensor. We denote a tensor named "A" with this typeface: A. We identify the element of A at coordinates (i, j, k) by writing Ai,j,k.

One important operation on matrices is the transpose. The transpose of a matrix is the mirror image of the matrix across a diagonal line, called the main diagonal, running down and to the right, starting from its upper left corner. See figure 2.1 for a graphical depiction of this operation. We denote the transpose of a matrix A as A, and it is defined such that

(A)i,j = Aj,i.

Vectors can be thought of as matrices that contain only one column. The transpose of a vector is therefore a matrix with only one row. Sometimes we
