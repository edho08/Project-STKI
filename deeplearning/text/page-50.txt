CHAPTER 2. LINEAR ALGEBRA

Matrix product operations have many useful properties that make mathematical

analysis of matrices more convenient. For example, matrix multiplication is

distributive:

A(B + C) = AB + AC.

(2.6)

It is also associative:

A(BC) = (AB)C.

(2.7)

Matrix multiplication is not commutative (the condition AB = BA does not

always hold), unlike scalar multiplication. However, the dot product between two

vectors is commutative:

xy = yx.

(2.8)

The transpose of a matrix product has a simple form: (AB) = B A.

(2.9)

This allows us to demonstrate equation 2.8, by exploiting the fact that the value

of such a product is a scalar and therefore equal to its own transpose:

x y

=

 xy



=

yx.

(2.10)

Since the focus of this textbook is not linear algebra, we do not attempt to develop a comprehensive list of useful properties of the matrix product here, but the reader should be aware that many more exist.

We now know enough linear algebra notation to write down a system of linear

equations:

Ax = b

(2.11)

where A  Rm×n is a known matrix, b  Rm is a known vector, and x  Rn is a vector of unknown variables we would like to solve for. Each element xi of x is one of these unknown variables. Each row of A and each element of b provide another constraint. We can rewrite equation 2.11 as:

A1,:x = b1

(2.12)

or, even more explicitly, as:

A2,:x = b2 ...
Am,:x = bm

(2.13) (2.14) (2.15)

A1,1 x1 + A1,2x2 + · · · + A1,nxn = b1

(2.16)
