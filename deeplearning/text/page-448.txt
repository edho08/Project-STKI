Figure 11.2: Comparison of grid search and random search. For illustration purposes we display two hyperparameters but we are typically interested in having many more. (Left)To perform grid search, we provide a set of values for each hyperparameter. The search algorithm runs training for every joint hyperparameter setting in the cross product of these sets. (Right)To perform random search, we provide a probability distribution over joint hyperparameter configurations. Usually most of these hyperparameters are independent from each other. Common choices for the distribution over a single hyperparameter include uniform and log-uniform (to sample from a log-uniform distribution, take the exp of a sample from a uniform distribution). The search algorithm then randomly samples joint hyperparameter configurations and runs training with each of them. Both grid search and random search evaluate the validation set error and return the best configuration. The figure illustrates the typical case where only some hyperparameters have a significant influence on the result. In this illustration, only the hyperparameter on the horizontal axis has a significant effect. Grid search wastes an amount of computation that is exponential in the number of non-influential hyperparameters, while random search tests a unique value of every influential hyperparameter on nearly every trial.
