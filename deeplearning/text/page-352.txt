Figure 9.3: Sparse connectivity, viewed from above: We highlight one output unit, s3, and also highlight the input units in x that affect this unit. These units are known as the receptive field of s3. (Top)When s is formed by convolution with a kernel of width 3, only three inputs affect s3. (Bottom)When s is formed by matrix multiplication, connectivity is no longer sparse, so all of the inputs affect s3.

Figure 9.4: The receptive field of the units in the deeper layers of a convolutional network is larger than the receptive field of the units in the shallow layers. This effect increases if the network includes architectural features like strided convolution (figure 9.12) or pooling (section 9.3). This means that even though direct connections in a convolutional net are very sparse, units in the deeper layers can be indirectly connected to all or most of the input image.
