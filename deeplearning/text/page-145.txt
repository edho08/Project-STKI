CHAPTER 5. MACHINE LEARNING BASICS
The MSE measures the overall expected deviation--in a squared error sense-- between the estimator and the true value of the parameter . As is clear from equation 5.54, evaluating the MSE incorporates both the bias and the variance. Desirable estimators are those with small MSE and these are estimators that manage to keep both their bias and variance somewhat in check.

Figure 5.6: As capacity increases (x-axis), bias (dotted) tends to decrease and variance (dashed) tends to increase, yielding another U-shaped curve for generalization error (bold curve). If we vary capacity along one axis, there is an optimal capacity, with underfitting when the capacity is below this optimum and overfitting when it is above. This relationship is similar to the relationship between capacity, underfitting, and overfitting, discussed in section 5.2 and figure 5.3.
The relationship between bias and variance is tightly linked to the machine learning concepts of capacity, underfitting and overfitting. In the case where generalization error is measured by the MSE (where bias and variance are meaningful components of generalization error), increasing capacity tends to increase variance and decrease bias. This is illustrated in figure 5.6, where we see again the U-shaped curve of generalization error as a function of capacity.

5.4.5 Consistency
So far we have discussed the properties of various estimators for a training set of fixed size. Usually, we are also concerned with the behavior of an estimator as the amount of training data grows. In particular, we usually wish that, as the number of data points m in our dataset increases, our point estimates converge to the true
