For sample k, we can derive the importance weight by chaining together the

importance weights for the jumps between the intermediate distributions given in

equation 18.49:

w (k) =

p~1 (x(k1)) p~0(x (k1))

p~2(x

(k) 2

)

p~1(x

(k) 2

)

.

.

.

p~

p~1 (x(1k) ) n-1(x(kn))

.

(18.52)

To avoid numerical issues such as overflow, it is probably best to compute log w(k) by adding and subtracting log probabilities, rather than computing w(k) by multiplying

and dividing probabilities.

With the sampling procedure thus defined and the importance weights given in equation 18.52, the estimate of the ratio of partition functions is given by:

Z1  1  K w(k)

Z0

K
k=1

(18.53)

In order to verify that this procedure defines a valid importance sampling scheme, we can show (Neal, 2001) that the AIS procedure corresponds to simple importance sampling on an extended state space with points sampled over the product space [x1, . . . , xn-1, x1]. To do this, we define the distribution over the extended space as:

p~(x1 , . . . , xn-1, x1) =p~1(x1)T~n-1(x n-1 | x 1)T~n-2(xn-2 | xn-1 ) . . . T~1 (x1 | x2 ),

(18.54) (18.55)

where T~a is the reverse of the transition operator defined by Ta (via an application of Bayes' rule):

T~a (x

x)

=

pa(x) pa(x)

T

a(x

|

x)

=

p~a (x) p~a (x)

(18.56)

Plugging the above into the expression for the joint distribution on the extended state space given in equation 18.55, we get:

p~(x1 , . . . , xn-1, x1)
