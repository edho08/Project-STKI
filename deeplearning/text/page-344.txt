CHAPTER 8. OPTIMIZATION FOR TRAINING DEEP MODELS
more prototypical examples and then help the learner refine the decision surface with the less obvious cases. Curriculum-based strategies are more effective for teaching humans than strategies based on uniform sampling of examples, and can also increase the effectiveness of other teaching strategies (Basu and Christensen, 2013).
Another important contribution to research on curriculum learning arose in the context of training recurrent neural networks to capture long-term dependencies: Zaremba and Sutskever (2014) found that much better results were obtained with a stochastic curriculum, in which a random mix of easy and difficult examples is always presented to the learner, but where the average proportion of the more difficult examples (here, those with longer-term dependencies) is gradually increased. With a deterministic curriculum, no improvement over the baseline (ordinary training from the full training set) was observed.
We have now described the basic family of neural network models and how to regularize and optimize them. In the chapters ahead, we turn to specializations of the neural network family, that allow neural networks to scale to very large sizes and process input data that has special structure. The optimization methods discussed in this chapter are often directly applicable to these specialized architectures with little or no modification.
