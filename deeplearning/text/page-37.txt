CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
Figure 1.9: Example inputs from the MNIST dataset. The "NIST" stands for National Institute of Standards and Technology, the agency that originally collected this data. The "M" stands for "modified," since the data has been preprocessed for easier use with machine learning algorithms. The MNIST dataset consists of scans of handwritten digits and associated labels describing which digit 0­9 is contained in each image. This simple classification problem is one of the simplest and most widely used tests in deep learning research. It remains popular despite being quite easy for modern techniques to solve. Geoffrey Hinton has described it as "the drosophila of machine learning," meaning that it allows machine learning researchers to study their algorithms in controlled laboratory conditions, much as biologists often study fruit flies.
