Monte Carlo Methods
Randomized algorithms fall into two rough categories: Las Vegas algorithms and Monte Carlo algorithms. Las Vegas algorithms always return precisely the correct answer (or report that they failed). These algorithms consume a random amount of resources, usually memory or time. In contrast, Monte Carlo algorithms return answers with a random amount of error. The amount of error can typically be reduced by expending more resources (usually running time and memory). For any fixed computational budget, a Monte Carlo algorithm can provide an approximate answer.
Many problems in machine learning are so difficult that we can never expect to obtain precise answers to them. This excludes precise deterministic algorithms and Las Vegas algorithms. Instead, we must use deterministic approximate algorithms or Monte Carlo approximations. Both approaches are ubiquitous in machine learning. In this chapter, we focus on Monte Carlo methods.
17.1 Sampling and Monte Carlo Methods
Many important technologies used to accomplish machine learning goals are based on drawing samples from some probability distribution and using these samples to form a Monte Carlo estimate of some desired quantity.
17.1.1 Why Sampling?
There are many reasons that we may wish to draw samples from a probability distribution. Sampling provides a flexible way to approximate many sums and
