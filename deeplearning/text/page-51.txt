Matrix-vector product notation provides a more compact representation for equations of this form.

2.3 Identity and Inverse Matrices

Linear algebra offers a powerful tool called matrix inversion that allows us to analytically solve equation 2.11 for many values of A.
To describe matrix inversion, we first need to define the concept of an identity matrix. An identity matrix is a matrix that does not change any vector when we multiply that vector by that matrix. We denote the identity matrix that preserves n-dimensional vectors as In. Formally, In  Rn×n, and

x  Rn, Inx = x.

(2.20)

The structure of the identity matrix is simple: all of the entries along the main

diagonal are 1, while all of the other entries are zero. See figure 2.2 for an example.

The matrix inverse of A is denoted as A-1, and it is defined as the matrix

such that

A-1A = In.

(2.21)

We can now solve equation 2.11 by the following steps:

Ax = b A-1Ax = A -1b
In x = A-1b
