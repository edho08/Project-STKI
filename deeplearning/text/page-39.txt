Figure 1.10: Initially, the number of connections between neurons in artificial neural

networks was limited by hardware capabilities. Today, the number of connections between

neurons is mostly a design consideration. Some artificial neural networks have nearly as

many connections per neuron as a cat, and it is quite common for other neural networks

to have as many connections per neuron as smaller mammals like mice. Even the human

brain does not have an exorbitant amount of connections per neuron. Biological neural

network sizes from Wikipedia (2015).
