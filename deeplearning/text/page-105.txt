Figure 4.5: A saddle point containing both positive and negative curvature. The function in this example is f (x) = x21 - x22. Along the axis corresponding to x1, the function curves upward. This axis is an eigenvector of the Hessian and has a positive eigenvalue.
Along the axis corresponding to x2, the function curves downward. This direction is an eigenvector of the Hessian with negative eigenvalue. The name "saddle point" derives from the saddle-like shape of this function. This is the quintessential example of a function with a saddle point. In more than one dimension, it is not necessary to have an eigenvalue
of 0 in order to get a saddle point: it is only necessary to have both positive and negative eigenvalues. We can think of a saddle point with both signs of eigenvalues as being a local maximum within one cross section and a local minimum within another cross section.
