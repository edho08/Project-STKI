Functions f : A  B The function f with domain A and range B

f  g Composition of the functions f and g

f (x; )

A function of x parametrized by . (Sometimes we write f(x) and omit the argument  to lighten notation)

log x (x) (x)

Natural logarithm of x

Logistic

sigmoid,

1 1 + exp(-x)

Softplus, log(1 + exp(x))

||x||p ||x|| x+

Lp norm of x L2 norm of x Positive part of x, i.e., max(0, x)

1condition is 1 if the condition is true, 0 otherwise
Sometimes we use a function f whose argument is a scalar but apply it to a vector, matrix, or tensor: f (x), f(X), or f (X). This denotes the application of f to the array element-wise. For example, if C = (X), then Ci,j,k = (Xi,j,k) for all valid values of i, j and k.
