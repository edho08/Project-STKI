Figure 20.3: A deep Boltzmann machine, re-arranged to reveal its bipartite graph structure.

In comparison to the RBM energy function (equation 20.5), the DBM energy function includes connections between the hidden units (latent variables) in the form of the weight matrices (W(2) and W (3)). As we will see, these connections have significant consequences for both the model behavior as well as how we go
about performing inference in the model.

In comparison to fully connected Boltzmann machines (with every unit connected to every other unit), the DBM offers some advantages that are similar to those offered by the RBM. Specifically, as illustrated in figure 20.3, the DBM layers can be organized into a bipartite graph, with odd layers on one side and even layers on the other. This immediately implies that when we condition on the variables in the even layer, the variables in the odd layers become conditionally independent. Of course, when we condition on the variables in the odd layers, the variables in the even layers also become conditionally independent.

The bipartite structure of the DBM means that we can apply the same equa-

tions we have previously used for the conditional distributions of an RBM to

determine the conditional distributions in a DBM. The units within a layer are

conditionally independent from each other given the values of the neighboring

layers, so the distributions over binary variables can be fully described by the

Bernoulli parameters giving the probability of each unit being active. In our

example with two hidden layers, the activation probabilities are given by:





P (vi = 1 | h(1)) =  Wi(,:1)h(1) ,
