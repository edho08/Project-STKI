CHAPTER 2. LINEAR ALGEBRA

At this point, it can be helpful to rewrite the problem in terms of a single
design matrix of examples, rather than as a sum over separate example vectors. This will allow us to use more compact notation. Let X  Rm×n be the matrix defined by stacking all of the vectors describing the points, such that Xi,: = x (i) . We can now rewrite the problem as

d = arg min ||X - Xdd||2F subject to dd = 1.
d

(2.72)

Disregarding the constraint for the moment, we can simplify the Frobenius norm

portion as follows:

arg

(2.73) (2.74)

d

(by equation 2.49)

= arg min Tr(XX - X Xdd - ddXX + dd XXdd)
d

(2.75)

= arg min Tr(X X) - Tr(XXdd) - Tr(ddX X) + Tr(ddXXdd )

d
= arg min - Tr(XXdd) - Tr(ddXX) + Tr(ddX Xdd )

(2.76) (2.77)

d

(because terms not involving d do not affect the arg min)

= arg min -2 Tr(X Xdd) + Tr(ddXXdd )
d

(2.78)

(because we can cycle the order of the matrices inside a trace, equation 2.52)

= arg min -2 Tr(X Xdd) + Tr(XXdddd )
d

(2.79)

(using the same property again) At this point, we re-introduce the constraint:

arg min -2 Tr(XXdd ) + Tr(XXdddd) subject to dd = 1
d
= arg min -2 Tr(XXdd) + Tr(X Xdd) subject to dd = 1
d
(due to the constraint)

(2.80) (2.81)

= arg min - Tr(XXdd ) subject to dd = 1
d
