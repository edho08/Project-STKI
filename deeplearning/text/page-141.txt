CHAPTER 5. MACHINE LEARNING BASICS

Recall that the Gaussian probability density function is given by





p(x(i); µ,  2) =  1 exp 22

- 12

(x(i) - 2

µ)2

.

(5.29)

A common estimator of the Gaussian mean parameter is known as the sample

mean:

µ^m

=

1 m

 m

x(i)

i=1

(5.30)

To determine the bias of the sample mean, we are again interested in calculating its expectation:

bias(µ^ m )

= =

E[µ^m] 1
E m

-µ

 m

 x(i)

-

i=1

= µ-µ= 0

Thus we find that the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of Gaussian mean parameter.

Example: Estimators of the Variance of a Gaussian Distribution As an example, we compare two different estimators of the variance parameter 2 of a Gaussian distribution. We are interested in knowing if either estimator is biased.
The first estimator of 2 we consider is known as the sample variance:

where µ^m is the sample mean, defined above. More formally, we are interested in

computing

bias(^ 2m) = E[^m2 ] - 2
