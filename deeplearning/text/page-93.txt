Figure 3.7: A directed graphical model over random variables a, b, c, d and e. This graph corresponds to probability distributions that can be factored as

p(a, b, c, d, e) = p(a)p(b | a)p(c | a, b)p(d | b)p(e | c).

This graph allows us to quickly see some properties of the distribution. For example, a and c interact directly, but a and e interact only indirectly via c.

are usually not probability distributions of any kind. Any set of nodes that are all connected to each other in G is called a clique. Each clique C(i) in an undirected model is associated with a factor  (i)(C(i) ). These factors are just functions, not
probability distributions. The output of each factor must be non-negative, but
there is no constraint that the factor must sum or integrate to 1 like a probability
distribution.

The probability of a configuration of random variables is proportional to the product of all of these factors--assignments that result in larger factor values are more likely. Of course, there is no guarantee that this product will sum to 1. We therefore divide by a normalizing constant Z, defined to be the sum or integral over all states of the product of the  functions, in order to obtain a normalized probability distribution:

See figure 3.8 for an example of an undirected graph and the factorization of probability distributions it represents.
Keep in mind that these graphical representations of factorizations are a language for describing probability distributions. They are not mutually exclusive families of probability distributions. Being directed or undirected is not a property of a probability distribution; it is a property of a particular description of a
