CHAPTER 5. MACHINE LEARNING BASICS
Figure 5.13: Training examples from the QMUL Multiview Face Dataset (Gong et al., 2000) for which the subjects were asked to move in such a way as to cover the two-dimensional manifold corresponding to two angles of rotation. We would like learning algorithms to be able to discover and disentangle such manifold coordinates. Figure 20.6 illustrates such a feat.
