Figure 12.2: A comparison of global and local contrast normalization. Visually, the effects of global contrast normalization are subtle. It places all images on roughly the same scale, which reduces the burden on the learning algorithm to handle multiple scales. Local contrast normalization modifies the image much more, discarding all regions of constant intensity. This allows the model to focus on just the edges. Regions of fine texture, such as the houses in the second row, may lose some detail due to the bandwidth of the normalization kernel being too high.

channels separately while others combine information from different channels to normalize each pixel (Sermanet et al., 2012).
Local contrast normalization can usually be implemented efficiently by using separable convolution (see section 9.8) to compute feature maps of local means and local standard deviations, then using element-wise subtraction and element-wise division on different feature maps.
Local contrast normalization is a differentiable operation and can also be used as a nonlinearity applied to the hidden layers of a network, as well as a preprocessing operation applied to the input.
As with global contrast normalization, we typically need to regularize local contrast normalization to avoid division by zero. In fact, because local contrast normalization typically acts on smaller windows, it is even more important to regularize. Smaller windows are more likely to contain values that are all nearly the same as each other, and thus more likely to have zero standard deviation.
