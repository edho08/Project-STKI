Figure 6.7: Deeper models tend to perform better. This is not merely because the model is larger. This experiment from Goodfellow et al. (2014d) shows that increasing the number of parameters in layers of convolutional networks without increasing their depth is not nearly as effective at increasing test set performance. The legend indicates the depth of network used to make each curve and whether the curve represents variation in the size of the convolutional or the fully connected layers. We observe that shallow models in this context overfit at around 20 million parameters while deep ones can benefit from having over 60 million. This suggests that using a deep model expresses a useful preference over the space of functions the model can learn. Specifically, it expresses a belief that the function should consist of many simpler functions composed together. This could result either in learning a representation that is composed in turn of simpler representations (e.g., corners defined in terms of edges) or in learning a program with sequentially dependent steps (e.g., first locate a set of objects, then segment them from each other, then recognize them).
