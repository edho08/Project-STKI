Figure 9.12: Convolution with a stride. In this example, we use a stride of two. (Top)Convolution with a stride length of two implemented in a single operation. (Bottom)Convolution with a stride greater than one pixel is mathematically equivalent to convolution with unit stride followed by downsampling. Obviously, the two-step approach involving downsampling is computationally wasteful, because it computes many values that are then discarded.
