Structured Probabilistic Models
for Deep Learning
Deep learning draws upon many modeling formalisms that researchers can use to guide their design efforts and describe their algorithms. One of these formalisms is the idea of structured probabilistic models. We have already discussed structured probabilistic models briefly in section 3.14. That brief presentation was sufficient to understand how to use structured probabilistic models as a language to describe some of the algorithms in part II. Now, in part III, structured probabilistic models are a key ingredient of many of the most important research topics in deep learning. In order to prepare to discuss these research ideas, this chapter describes structured probabilistic models in much greater detail. This chapter is intended to be self-contained; the reader does not need to review the earlier introduction before continuing with this chapter.
A structured probabilistic model is a way of describing a probability distribution, using a graph to describe which random variables in the probability distribution interact with each other directly. Here we use "graph" in the graph theory sense--a set of vertices connected to one another by a set of edges. Because the structure of the model is defined by a graph, these models are often also referred to as graphical models.
The graphical models research community is large and has developed many different models, training algorithms, and inference algorithms. In this chapter, we provide basic background on some of the most central ideas of graphical models, with an emphasis on the concepts that have proven most useful to the deep learning research community. If you already have a strong background in graphical models, you may wish to skip most of this chapter. However, even a graphical model expert
