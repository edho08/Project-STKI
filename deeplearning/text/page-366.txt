Figure 9.13: The effect of zero padding on network size: Consider a convolutional network with a kernel of width six at every layer. In this example, we do not use any pooling, so only the convolution operation itself shrinks the network size. (Top)In this convolutional network, we do not use any implicit zero padding. This causes the representation to shrink by five pixels at each layer. Starting from an input of sixteen pixels, we are only able to have three convolutional layers, and the last layer does not ever move the kernel, so arguably only two of the layers are truly convolutional. The rate of shrinking can be mitigated by using smaller kernels, but smaller kernels are less expressive and some shrinking is inevitable in this kind of architecture. (Bottom)By adding five implicit zeroes to each layer, we prevent the representation from shrinking with depth. This allows us to make an arbitrarily deep convolutional network.
