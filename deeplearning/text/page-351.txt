Figure 9.2: Sparse connectivity, viewed from below: We highlight one input unit, x3, and also highlight the output units in s that are affected by this unit. (Top)When s is formed by convolution with a kernel of width 3, only three outputs are affected by x.
(Bottom)When s is formed by matrix multiplication, connectivity is no longer sparse, so all of the outputs are affected by x3.
