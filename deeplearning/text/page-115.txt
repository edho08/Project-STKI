CHAPTER 5. MACHINE LEARNING BASICS
Many kinds of tasks can be solved with machine learning. Some of the most common machine learning tasks include the following:
· Classification: In this type of task, the computer program is asked to specify which of k categories some input belongs to. To solve this task, the learning algorithm is usually asked to produce a function f : Rn  {1, . . . , k}. When y = f (x), the model assigns an input described by vector x to a category identified by numeric code y. There are other variants of the classification task, for example, where f outputs a probability distribution over classes. An example of a classification task is object recognition, where the input is an image (usually described as a set of pixel brightness values), and the output is a numeric code identifying the object in the image. For example, the Willow Garage PR2 robot is able to act as a waiter that can recognize different kinds of drinks and deliver them to people on command (Goodfellow et al., 2010). Modern object recognition is best accomplished with deep learning (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015). Object recognition is the same basic technology that allows computers to recognize faces (Taigman et al., 2014), which can be used to automatically tag people in photo collections and allow computers to interact more naturally with their users.
· Classification with missing inputs: Classification becomes more challenging if the computer program is not guaranteed that every measurement in its input vector will always be provided. In order to solve the classification task, the learning algorithm only has to define a single function mapping from a vector input to a categorical output. When some of the inputs may be missing, rather than providing a single classification function, the learning algorithm must learn a set of functions. Each function corresponds to classifying x with a different subset of its inputs missing. This kind of situation arises frequently in medical diagnosis, because many kinds of medical tests are expensive or invasive. One way to efficiently define such a large set of functions is to learn a probability distribution over all of the relevant variables, then solve the classification task by marginalizing out the missing variables. With n input variables, we can now obtain all 2n different classification functions needed for each possible set of missing inputs, but we only need to learn a single function describing the joint probability distribution. See Goodfellow et al. (2013b) for an example of a deep probabilistic model applied to such a task in this way. Many of the other tasks described in this section can also be generalized to work with missing inputs; classification with missing inputs is just one example of what machine learning can do.
