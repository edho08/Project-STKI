Figure 16.9: From this graph, we can read out several d-separation properties. Examples include:
 a and b are d-separated given the empty set.  a and e are d-separated given c.  d and e are d-separated given c. We can also see that some variables are no longer d-separated when we observe some variables:  a and b are not d-separated given c.  a and b are not d-separated given d.
